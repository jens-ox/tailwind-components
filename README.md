# Tailwind Components

First of all, this is more of an experiment. Obviously, only the Tailwind UI components with publicly available source are considered here.

In the [Full-Stack Developer job post](https://jobs.tailwindui.com/full-stack-developer), one of the tasks is building official Tailwind UI components for React and Vue. Why not leverage Web Components? [According to custom-elements-everywhere](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/), Web Components are starting to become natively usable in most frontend frameworks (or libraries).

## Development

```bash
git clone [repo] && cd [repo]
npm install # or yarn
npm run dev # or yarn dev
```
